		<p>My name is Zackary Misso, and I am currently a Sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. I am also a member of the Turing Scholar Honors program at UT.</p>
		<p>I discovered my passion for Computer Science during my four years at Cedar Park High School after taking an introductory Computer Science class. However, I did not put in as much time into side projects during high school because I was busy playing soccer for my high school varsity and club teams. During my senior year, I became the captain of my school's UIL Computer Science team. To prepare for the UIL tests, I created a study guide that my high school, and Vandergrift high school, still use. My senior year was the first year one of our team members scored above a 200 on the District test. Actually, three of the four members of our team scored above a 200. We advanced to regionals and tied for second place but lost the tiebreaker so my UIL career ended there.</p>
		<p>During my freshman year at UT I worked as one of three software developers in a local start-up called <a href="http://www.freeput.net">Freeput</a>. It was an amazing experiance with a group of amazing people. We spent a year trying to design a piece of hardware parapeligics could use to interface with a computer. At first we experimented with existing virtual reality devices such as the Epoc, Leap Motion, and Oculus Rift. After having no success, we built our own hardware and had a very promising demo, however we had to put everything on hold since the summer of 2014 due to the lack of financial resources.</p>
		<p>The summer after my freshman year, I applied for a research fellowship with the Freshman Research Initiative program at UT. I was not awarded the fellowship, however after I talked with my research mentor, Joel Lehman, he agreed to oversee my research over the summer despite not being awarded the fellowship. My research involved using the NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augmented Topologies) algorithm to develop an Artificial Intelligent agent to play and beat the Super Mario game for the SNES.</p>
		<p>This upcoming summer I will be in San Diego interning with Qualcomm.</p>
