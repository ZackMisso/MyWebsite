		<h2><u>Professional Bio:</u></h2>
		<p>My name is Zackary Misso, and I am currently a Sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. I am also a member of the Turing Scholar Honors program at UT. I aspire to become a Professor of Computer Science, however I am still unsure what topic I want to do research in. My interests are in Physics, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Graphics.</p>
		<p>I discovered my passion for Computer Science during my four years at Cedar Park High School after taking an introductory Computer Science class. However, I did not put in as much time into side projects during high school because I was busy playing soccer for my high school varsity and club teams. During my senior year, I became the captain of my school's UIL Computer Science team. To prepare for the UIL tests, I created a study guide that my high school, and Vandergrift high school, still use. My senior year was the first year one of our team members scored above a 200 on the District test. Actually, three of the four members of our team scored above a 200. We advanced to regionals and tied for second place but lost the tiebreaker so my UIL career ended there.</p>
		<p>During my freshman year at UT I worked as one of three software developers in a local start-up called <a href="http://www.freeput.net">Freeput</a>. It was an amazing experiance with a group of amazing people. We spent a year trying to design a piece of hardware parapeligics could use to interface with a computer. At first we experimented with existing virtual reality devices such as the Epoc, Leap Motion, and Oculus Rift. After having no success, we built our own hardware and had a very promising demo, however we had to put everything on hold since the summer of 2014 due to the lack of financial resources.</p>
		<p>The summer after my freshman year, I applied for a research fellowship with the Freshman Research Initiative program at UT. I was not awarded the fellowship, however after I talked with my research mentor, Joel Lehman, he agreed to oversee my research over the summer despite not being awarded the fellowship. My research involved using the NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augmented Topologies) algorithm to develop an Artificial Intelligent agent to play and beat the Super Mario game for the SNES.</p>
		<p>This upcoming summer I will be in San Diego interning with Qualcomm.</p>

		<h2><u>Game Design Bio:<u></h2>
		<p>I am keeping this part seperate from my "professional" bio because making video games, for me, is a hobby. However, it is still something I enjoy and because of that I will be using this website to also display the games that I make. The name of this site is even a homage to the name of the Game Dev studios I dreamed of creating as a young kid. Firal, being the name of a character I created as a kid and may appear in one of my games. So I guess I started out my Game Development hobby with the Game Maker Engine. I created and published two games on Game Maker when I was, I think, 12 years old. One was a Maze game called Maze Master, and the other.... I dont remember what I called it. The second one was a simple adventure game where you played as a stick figure and tried to shot enemy stick figures to go to the next room once all were killed. Both were pretty terrible, created over a week, and had no animations or sounds whatsoever. Although, I am still proud of these games because they were my first programming (if you consider gml programming) projects.</p>
		<p>Now jump forward about five years to when I was 17 years old. A friend and I decided to try to enter into a competition to create the most popular app for Facebook in a month. We decided to create a game, both having no idea what we were doing, and away we went. We made the a simple endless runner game in Java, however we were never able to publish the game to Facebook. It was also pretty terible, however this experiance taught me the inner workings of a simple Game Engine. Thus, it opened my eyes to a new interest of mine which is Game Engine design (that will be a project for the future).</p>
		<p>Currently, I only have two more games under my belt. Both were created during Game Jams during the previous two years. The first one was a multiplier Space Invaders-ish game that came in second place in its game jam and was made in eight hours by a group of four people (link to a video of the game will be added soon). The second game won the Best Gameplay award in its respective game jam and was created in 24 hours (link to video of the game will be added soon).</p>
		<p>Beginning in June 2015, I am setting a goal to make and publish a game every 3 months. Those games will be published on GameJolt so look forward to them. I have also made a twitch channel where I am going to be streaming the development for my games in an attempt to get people to critique my work/development process so I can better my skills.</p>
