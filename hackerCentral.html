		<p>This project is an idea I thought of to improve my organizational skills in all forms of my life. The idea is to make an application that can help me keep track of what I need to do in separate sectors of my life including finances, personal projects, fitness, etc. Now, most people use calendars, phone reminders, Quicken, and all other forms of applications to manage specific parts of their life, but I would prefer to have one single application that allows me to keep track of everything.</p>
		<p>While working with Qualcomm I became exposed to Agile development, and during the process of Agile development, developers create many small tasks that they think they can complete in a very short period of time. Over many of these short periods, these small tasks accumulate to fulfilling larger tasks. It is this principle that I am going to base this application on. The application will allow the user to make tasks in specific areas of his/her life and track their progress in completing these tasks. The initial project will simply store its data to some files, however I plan on storing all of the data to a SQL Database on my server, however, since I will not be back in Texas until August I will have to make due with a directory structure.</p>
		<p>The areas this application will be used for are: my Coding Projects, Fitness, Behavioral (i.e. how much I sleep, diet, etc.), Art, Music, School, and my Computer Science Research. Currently I have about half of the Coding Projects tracking and Tasks system working. I plan on spending two to three weeks implementing each one of these.</p>
