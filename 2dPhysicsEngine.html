		<h3>2D Physics Engine</h3>
		<p>To view the repository for this project go <a href"https://github.com/ZackMisso/PhysicsEngine">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Physical Simulation has always been an interest of mine, so for an initial experiment within this field I am going to be implementing a two dimensional physics engine. This physics engine will be able to simulate and resolve collisions between any n-sided polygon of various shapes and sizes.</p>
		<p>I am currently in the process of implementing this project, however once I am done with the engine I plan on testing it on these benchmarks</p>
		<p>Pin Matrix Simulation: An old game I remember playing at Chuck-e-Cheese as a kid involved dropping a token into a matrix of pins where every other row of pins were shifted such that the pins in two consecutive rows were never vertically aligned. The token would fall into the matrix and bounce around until it finally fell from the bottom of the matrix at a different horizontal location from where it was dropped. This pin matrix x token collision will be one benchmark of the physics engine.</p>
		<p>Cannon Collision: This benchmark will consist of a few columns of continuously generated objects falling from the top of the window to the bottom. The person running the benchmark can press a button to fire a randomly chosen n-sided object from a cannon on the far left side of the screen into the falling objects.</p>
		<p>Physics Tetris: Basically dropping random n-sided objects into a box similar to the format of Tetris.</p>
		<p>I will add more benchmarks as I develop more ideas.</p>
