		<p>Welcome to the site! This site is dedicated to displaying the works of Zackary Misso. Hope you enjoy what I have worked on, and feel free to send me an email about what you think.</p>
		<p>This website is still under construction, however it is going to be updated every Saturday. The website is currently just a draft so please ignore any grammatical or spelling errors. I am finishing the design and getting all of the pages set up for the initial site before I pay attention to the actual content</p>
