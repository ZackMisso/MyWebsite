		<p>Welcome to the site! This site is dedicated to displaying the works of Zackary Misso. Hope you enjoy what I have worked on, and feel free to send me an email about what you think.</p>
		<p>This website is still under construction, however it is going to be updated every Saturday or Sunday. I am still working on the design for the site as well as adding content so nothing on this site is currently finished. Please forgive me for any broken links and empty pages until I get a finished draft completed.</p>
		<p>While the site is being worked on please feel free to view my GitHub profile <a href="https://github.com/ZackMisso">here</a> if you are interested in my programming projects or my LinkedIn profile <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/preview?locale=en_US&trk=prof-0-sb-preview-primary-button">here</a> if you are interested in my work experiance. My work experiance is also described in my <a href="bio.html">Bio</a> which is almost finished. I just need to proof read it.</p>
		<p>My Music and Art pages will be empty for a while because my priorities are on getting my Project pages done.</p>
