			<!-- Implementation of NEAT -->
			<h2>NEAT Research Project</h2>
			<!-- <img> -->
			<p style="max-width:1000px;margin-left:19%;text-indent:40px;color:#c0c0c0;">From Spring 2014 to Fall 2015, I worked on a research project within the University of Texas's
			Freshman Research Initiative program to attempt to develop an Artificial Intelligent agent to play
			and beat the SNES version of the Super Mario Bros. game using my own implementation of the NEAT
			algorithm. The Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies (NEAT) algorithm was originally developed by
			<a href="http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/">Dr. Stanley</a> for his dissertation and it provided a novel way to evolve a Neural Network to solve a
			problem by using an idea called speciation - separating neural nets into groups (species) that are
			similar and restricting which networks they can 'breed' with to only those within their species.
			Another key aspect of this algorithm is its evolution process includes mutation for both the
			Network structure and the weights of the individual neurons. Unlike Deep Learning, which creates
			large, non-changing network structure and then evolves the weights to solve some problem, NEAT begins
			with a population of the smallest possible network structure and expands it through mutation.</p>
			<p style="max-width:1000px;margin-left:19%;text-indent:40px;color:#c0c0c0;">Using Stanley's dissertation as a reference, I implemented my own version
			of it to be ran on my own implementation of the Super Mario Bros. game. As a part
			of a voluntary research fellowship, I worked, and for the most part finished, the implementation of NEAT
			over the summer after my Freshman year. During the next fall semester my colleague, Mark Bakke, joined
			me on this project and helped with implementing the game and running some of our experiments. The
			best individual that we were able to evolve on our last experiment can be seen in the video below.</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;color:#c0c0c0;">Video to be added will be added to the site soon.</p>

			<h4>(Work in Progress)</h4>
			<!-- <img> -->
			<p style="max-width:1000px;margin-left:19%;text-indent:40px;color:#c0c0c0;">Currently, I have been working on a three dimensional game engine as my current side project. Information
			will be added later as I get farther in the project, but for now you can view the project's source code <a href="https://github.com/ZackMisso/GameEngine">here</a>.

			<!-- RayTracing Algorithm -->
			<h2>Simple Ray Tracing Algorithm</h2>
			<!-- <img> -->
			<p style="max-width:1000px;margin-left:19%;text-indent:40px;color:#c0c0c0;">During Spring of 2015, I decided to try to learn more about the field of Computer Graphics, so
			as an initial project I decided to create implement a Ray Tracing algorithm. Ray Tracing is a
			technique for simulating the lighting for a scene where every pixel in the image for the scene is
			calculated by following a ray from that pixel straight into the scene, discovering what objects
			and where on those objects those rays intercept. From there, more rays are generated to
			bounce off from that location to simulate refraction and a ray is shot from that location to every
			light source in the scene to calculate the light for the pixel the initial ray represented based on the distance to the
			light source and the objects between the ray's origin and the light source.</p>

			<h2>Hacker Central</h2>
			<h4>(Work in Progress)</h4>
			<!-- <img> -->
			<p style="max-width:1000px;margin-left:19%;text-indent:40px;color:#c0c0c0;">I have always disliked having multiple different applications to organize the different aspects
			of my life. For example, using Outlook for my calendar, Excel files for keeping track of finances,
			and random text files within my side programming projects to keep track of future tasks. So, this
			application is a simple bare-bones solution to aggregate all aspects of my life into one application.
			It is currently a work in progress, but I have made a lot of progress on it and I plan on finishing
			a working version by September. One thing to note that I really am looking forward to integrating
			with this application is the personal Artificial Intelligent assistant, Cortana, on Windows 10. Since
			there is an API available that allows for programmable interactions between Cortana and the user, I am
			looking forward to making this application completely voice controlled.</p>

			<!-- Level Editor -->
			<h2>Level Editor</h2>
			<!-- <img> -->
			<p style="max-width:1000px;margin-left:19%;text-indent:40px;color:#c0c0c0;">As a spin off side project to aid in my implementation of Super Mario Bros, I began creating
			a Level Editor that could be used to make a level for any type of two dimensional game. To accomplish
			this I created it so that the level designer could assign each entity in the level the exact types
	    representing their variables in source code. Thus, making it so the level editor would be generic
			enough for a level designer to make a level for any imaginable game. I did not finish all of the
			functionality for this project that I initially wanted to implement, however, I plan on finishing it in the
			future. All of the required features for it to be a functioning level editor are implemented, and you
			can see a video of me displaying some of the implemented functionality below.</p>
