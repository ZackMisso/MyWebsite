		<p>If you want to connect with me through LinkedIn, here is a link to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/preview?locale=en_US&trk=prof-0-sb-preview-primary-button">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>
		<p>Here is a link to my <a href="https://github.com/ZackMisso">GitHub profile</a> if you would like to see the source code for my current projects.</p>
		<p>Here is a link to my <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/firalstudios">Twitch account</a>. I am currently trying to stream the development process (or at least the coding portion of development) for the games that I am making on my own. The videos are not narrated, but I am hoping to start adding in some dialouge once I move into my apartment this fall. Also, until my current projects are completed, I will probably not be working on any games.</p>
		<p>If you would like to contact me, please feel free to send be an email at zackmisso(at)firalstudios.com. I check it once a week (usually Saturday) so I will try to get back to you as soon as possible. I am open to colloaboration on most of my projects if any of them interest you as well.</p>
