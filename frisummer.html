		<h3>FRI Summer Fellowship</h3>
		<p>During the summer after my freshman year I participated in an unpaid research fellowship within the Freshman Research Initiative program at the University of Texas at Austin. My research involved using the NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies algorithm (NEAT) to evolve an AI to play and potentially beat the Super Mario Bros. game for the SNES. This opportunity led me to begin three separate projects. First, was the development of a <a href="levelEditor.html">Generic Two Dimensional Level Editor</a>. The second was my own <a href="mario.html">recreation</a> of the Super Mario Bros. game for SNES. The last project was my own implementation of NEAT.</p>
		<p>I made the decision early on to use my own implementation of NEAT and the game because I wanted the experience of implementing them myself. Over the initial summer of this research project, I was able to get a minimalistic version of the game and level editor working, but I was not able to finish my implementation of NEAT. That was finished by the end of my fall semester. <a href="neat.html">Here</a> is more information about my implementation of NEAT.</p>
